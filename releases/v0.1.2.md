ðŸŽ‰ k6dist `v0.1.2` is here!

## Fixes

- The executable bit of the k6 binary was removed for some reason while copying to the Docker image. Now the executable bit is explicitly set during copying.

## Refactors

- GitHub Action input environment variables are now handled automatically based on the command flag. The name of the environment variable is generated from the name of the flag. In this way, all environment variables belonging to flags are processed.

- The GitHub Action parameter corresponding to the positional argument is now `args`, i.e. the corresponding environment variable `INPUT_ARGS`. Its value is split using the shlex package.
